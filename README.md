# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to develop a full web application similar to AirBnB. The project involves several steps, starting with the creation of a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

### Command Interpreter
The command interpreter serves as the backbone of the project, allowing users to interact with AirBnB objects through a command-line interface. It enables users to perform various operations on AirBnB objects, including:

- Creating new objects (e.g., User, Place)
- Retrieving objects from a file or database
- Performing operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
- Updating attributes of objects
- Destroying objects

#### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script:
$ ./console.py

#### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, users can enter commands to interact with AirBnB objects. The `help` command provides a list of available commands along with their descriptions, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize the functionalities.

### Examples
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
EOF help quit

(hbnb)


### Requirements
The project adheres to specific requirements outlined for Python scripts and unit tests. These requirements ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability throughout the development process.

- **Python Scripts**: All Python scripts should meet the specified requirements, including proper documentation, adherence to coding standards, and executable permissions.
- **Python Unit Tests**: Unit tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase. They should be organized and executed according to the provided guidelines.

## Contributors
The success of this project is attributed to the contributions of the following individuals:

1. **Joseph Njoroge**
2. **Elton Wahinya**

Their dedication and collaboration have been instrumental in advancing the project towards its goals.

### Next Steps
With the command-line interpreter in place, the project will progress to subsequent stages, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development. Each stage builds upon the foundation established in this initial phase, bringing us closer to achieving the ultimate objective of creating a fully functional AirBnB clone.
