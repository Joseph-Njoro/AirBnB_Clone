# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

## Overview
This project is a part of the larger AirBnB Clone project, focused specifically on building the front end step-by-step.
The goal is to create simple static HTML pages, apply styling with CSS, and populate them with fake content.
This process helps in understanding how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages effectively.
